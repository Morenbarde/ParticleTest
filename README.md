# ParticleTest
A simple program for generating and interacting with particle effects. 
Will continue to update and edit as I test out particle effects for the first time. 
Written in C++ and using SFML.

Controls:
- Left click to create particles
- R to reset all particles
- WASD to accelerate particles in each direction
- Space to cycle throught particles created per click (PPC)
- Up/Down to change force applied by the mouse
- Left/Right to change the radius the mouse affects
- Period/Comma to change the friction on the particles
